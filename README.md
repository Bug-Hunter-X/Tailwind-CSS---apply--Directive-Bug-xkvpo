# Tailwind CSS `@apply` Directive Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when applying certain classes, specifically `text-center` in this example. The bug manifests inconsistently, appearing only under specific circumstances, making it difficult to diagnose.

## Bug Description
The `@apply` directive within a Javascript component fails to apply the `text-center` class correctly, resulting in misaligned text. This issue doesn't occur with all classes, making it a rather unusual case.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application (instructions may vary based on the application's structure).
4. Observe the misaligned text, indicative of the `text-center` class not being applied correctly.

## Solution
The solution provided addresses the root cause of this uncommon bug by ensuring proper class application. The approach might involve re-examining the application's CSS structure or employing alternative methods to apply styles.
